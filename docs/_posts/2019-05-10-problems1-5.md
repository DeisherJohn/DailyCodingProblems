These problems are mostly deal with different ways to use lists and how to travel in them. 

- Problem 1: Find a given sum in a list of int

### Problem Review:

problem: 2

**Question**: This problem was asked by Uber.
<p>Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].

Follow-up: what if you can't use division?</p>

**Answer One**

Given that division is allowed there is a simple way to achive a solution for this problem using only two loops through the list.

- First
Make a temp variable that is initialized to 1 and then iterate through the list multipling the values into temp.  

```python

product = 1

for num in listOfNumbers:
    product *= num

```

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** Remember to be careful with multiplying by zero

Case: our list is [1,2,0]

We expect the output to be [0,0,2] 

However, because we never check for a 0 the output will be [0,0,0]. A case to also consider is any list that has more that a single 0, the product will always be 0. because of this a better loop might look like the following. 

```python

product = 1
zeros_in_list = 0

for num in listOfNumbers:
    if num != 0:
        product *= num
    else:
        #skip multiplying the zero into the product
        zeros_in_list += 1

```

- Once we have the product its a simple matter of iterating through the list again and just dividing out the current index. 

```python

productList = list()

for num in listOfNumbers:
    #case where there are at least 2 zeros
    if zeros_in_list > 1:
        productList.append(0)
        continue

    #make sure that we do not divide by 0
    if num != 0 and zeros_in_list == 1:
        productList.append(0)
    elif num == 0:
        """
        since this is the case where there is ONLY one 0
        once it is found the value at this point is the 
        product of all the others.
        """
        productList.append(product)
    else:
        #regular numbers are divided out and push into the answer array.
        productList.append(product//num)

return productList

```
