These problems are mostly deal with different ways to use lists and how to travel in them. 

- Problem 1: Find a given sum in a list of int
-- [GitHub file: p1.py](https://github.com/DeisherJohn/DailyCodingProblems/blob/master/PythonSolutions/p1.py)

- Problem 2: Find the product of all numbers in a list except i
-- [GitHub file: p2.py](https://github.com/DeisherJohn/DailyCodingProblems/blob/master/PythonSolutions/p2.py)

- Problem 3: Serialize and Deserialize a binary tree
-- [GitHub file: p3.py](https://github.com/DeisherJohn/DailyCodingProblems/blob/master/PythonSolutions/p3.py)

- Problem 4: Find the smalled missing int from a list
-- [GitHub file: p4.py](https://github.com/DeisherJohn/DailyCodingProblems/blob/master/PythonSolutions/p4.py)

- Problem 5: Functional programming tuple pairs
-- [GitHub file: p5.py](https://github.com/DeisherJohn/DailyCodingProblems/blob/master/PythonSolutions/p5.py)

### Problem Review:

problem: 2

**Question**:This problem was asked by Uber.

<p>Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].

Follow-up: what if you can't use division?</p>
