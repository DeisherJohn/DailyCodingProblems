                <a href="https://deisherjohn.github.io/DailyCodingSolutions/">Website</a>
                <a href="https://github.com/DeisherJohn/DailyCodingSolutions">GitHub Repo</a>
                This project is goes through the coding problems provided by "Daily Coding Problems" where I show my solutions to problems and talk about some of the design choices I make.

                <a href="https://github.com/DeisherJohn/ZoomzLaserTagGUI">GitHub Repo</a>
                I designed a mobile controller for Zoomz Paintball to use with their laser tag equipment. This controller allows them to track game time and stats in real time as well as change gun parameters through a GUI.

        <h2 class="h2-seperator">My view of the future</h2>
            <p>I love that coding and electronics allow people to be able to reach beyond what they can do themselves. I believe that the future of most innovations lies at the intersection of programming, electronics, and everyday life.  The “Internet of Things” has shown the world that with a little investment and application of fundamental coding and engineering principals nearly any aspect of life can be automated. This push to bring the power of computing to simple daily activities is where I believe the strength of computer engineering shines.</p>
